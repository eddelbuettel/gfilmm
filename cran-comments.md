## Release summary

The CRAN checks of the previous version detected an error in the C++ code. I've 
found an error and I've fixed it, hopefully this error was the cause. I also 
fixed a NOTE ("all imports must be used").

## Test environments

* ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel & release)
* r-hub

## R CMD check results

OK
